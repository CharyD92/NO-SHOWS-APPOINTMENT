# NO-SHOWS-APPOINTMENT

### BY: CHARITY DIOH

### **Dataset**
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

Here is a list of all column names on this dataset
Client ID, Appoinment ID, Gender, Scheduled day, Appointment Day, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hipertension, Diabetes, Hipertension, Alcoholism, Handicap, SMS_received, No-show.

This dataset can be found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments

Before I started the exploration process, I did some data wrangling which involves; dropping columns which were not relevant to my analysis, renaming cloumns and fixing datatypes.

### **Summary of Findings**

Most persons did not receive the sms (more than 50% of the population). Hence contributing to their not showing up to the appointment. Less than 30% of the patient population were handicapped, hence could not make it to their appointment. Also more than 75% of the population are not beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia scholarhip program.
Finally we'v clearly seen that even though some persons received the sms, they still did NOT show up for the appointment because they are either handicapped or not benefitting from the scholarship program.
